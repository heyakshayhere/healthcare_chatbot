Ectopic pregnancy

An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg develops outside the womb.
This usually happens in one of the fallopian tubes which lead from your ovaries to your womb. If an egg implants there, it can't develop into a baby.
Ectopic pregnancy puts your health at risk too, and can be very serious if it isn't treated.
About 1 in 100 pregnancies are an ectopic pregnancy.
Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy
Symptoms usually start when you’re about 6 weeks pregnant and can include:
pain low down and on one side of your abdomen
bleeding from your vagina
pain in the tip of your shoulder
discomfort when going to the toilet
a brown watery discharge from your vagina
You might also have:
other more general symptoms such as pale skin and sweating
missed a period
some of the early signs of being pregnant, such as feeling tired or having sore breasts
It’s important to get medical help quickly if you have any of these symptoms.
